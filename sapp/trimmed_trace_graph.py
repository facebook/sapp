#   distance >= 0 -> we found the leaf within distance hops
#   distance < 0 -> we didn't find the leaf within -distance hops
#
# NOTE: storing the "negative" distance captures that we did search for leaf
# before and couldn't find it within that many hops. This means that a future
# search with a distance remaining that is less or equal to the previously
# failed distance will also fail. We only revisit if the new visit has more
# "remaining" hops left.

# IMPORTANT: The leaf kinds are always the normalized transform kinds, i.e. with
# '@' replaced by ':'. This means we have to be careful at actual leaf-frames to
# compare with the normalized kinds, as well as when updating a frame's trace
# lengths.
